# Control Structures

# if is the first control structure we're going to learn,
# it's basically used for conditional application,
# where a given test clause is followed by one or several block.
# based on the test clause's answer, the conditions are met.

# %%
# control1.py

if 2 + 2 == 4:
    print(f"The answer is {4}.")

# %%
# control2.py

# The code below produces error, since it's not indented.

if 3 - 1 > -3:
print("You are right.")

# %%
# control3.py

if isinstance(23, int):
    print("This is a number.")
    print("I'm sure it's a number.")
    print("Come on, dude!")
# %%
